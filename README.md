# EEE443-Neural Networks
Homework and Project implementations for EEE443 Neural Networks - Bilkent University
## Coverage of the repository
### Tutorial 1
In this tutorial, I built a one-hidden-layer neural network and compared the performance of my model with a logistic regression model. I performed classification on data that lies in a plane in the space (2D feature space).

### Tutorial 2
In this tutorial, I implemented a neural network architecture with an arbitrary number of hidden layers. The network uses the ReLU activation function in the hidden layers.

### Tutorial 3
In this tutorial, I investigated gradient checking.

### Tutorial 4
In this tutorial, I learned about residual learning in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in particular ResNet architectures using Keras.
